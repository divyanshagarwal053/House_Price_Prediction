# House_Price_Prediction

This is a Data Science project in which I tried to predict house prices using different approaches.
In this, I used a dataset containing house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

In this project, I follow:
1. Import Libraries and Dataset
2. Data Wrangling
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: boxplot, regression plot, map using folium library

4. Model Development:
   Simple Linear Regression
   Multiple Linear regression
   Ridge regression
   Random Forest Regressor   
5. Model Evaluation and Refinement: MSE, correlation, r-squared
6. Used Pipelining, polynomial transform
